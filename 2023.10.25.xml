<P><I>1. The word initiator or igniter is sometimes used in place of the word detonator.</I>
</P>
<P><I>2. For the purposes of 1A007.b, the detonators of concern all utilize a small electrical conductor (bridge, bridge wire, or foil) that explosively vaporizes when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is passed through it. In non slapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical detonation in a contacting high explosive material such as PETN (pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators, the explosive vaporization of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper across a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts a chemical detonation. The slapper in some designs is driven by magnetic force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to either an EB or a slapper-type detonator.</I></P></NOTE>

<P>CW applies to 1C350.b and .c. The Commerce Country Chart is not designed to determine licensing requirements for items controlled for CW reasons. A license is required, for CW reasons, to export or reexport Schedule 2 chemicals and mixtures identified in 1C350.b to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR). A license is required, for CW reasons, to export Schedule 3 chemicals and mixtures identified in 1C350.c to States not Party to the CWC, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country has been obtained by the exporter prior to export. A license is required, for CW reasons, to reexport Schedule 3 chemicals and mixtures identified in 1C350.c from a State not Party to the CWC to any other State not Party to the CWC. (See § 742.18 of the EAR for license requirements and policies for toxic and precursor chemicals controlled for CW reasons. See § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements that apply to exports of Schedule 3 chemicals to countries not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR.)
</P>
<P>AT applies to entire entry. The Commerce Country Chart is not designed to determine licensing requirements for items controlled for AT reasons in 1C350.

<P><I>License Requirement Notes</I>
</P>
<P><I>1. SAMPLE SHIPMENTS: Subject to the following requirements and restrictions, a license is not required for sample shipments when the cumulative total of these shipments does not exceed a 55-gallon container or 200 kg of a single chemical to any one consignee during a calendar year. A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons.</I>
</P>
<P><I>a. Chemicals Not Eligible</I>
</P>
<P><I>A. [Reserved]</I>
</P>
<P><I>B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license.</I>
</P>
<P><I>b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license.</I>
</P>
<P><I>c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements).</I>
</P>
<P><I>d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.</I>
</P>
<P><I>e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.”</I>
</P>
<P><I>2. MIXTURES:</I>
</P>
<P><I>a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b through .d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs.</I>
</P>
<P><I>b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.</I>
</P>
<P><I>Note to Mixtures:
Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals:</I>
</P>
<P><I>a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations;</I>
</P>
<P><I>b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents.</I>
</P>
<P><I>3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.</I>
</P>
<P><I>4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)</I>
</P>
<P><I>Technical Notes:</I>
</P>
<P><I>1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions.</I>
</P>
<P><I>2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates.</I>
</P>
<P><I>3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates, isotopically-labeled forms or all possible stereoisomers) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.</I>

<NOTE>
<HED><I>Technical Notes:</I></HED>
<P><I>1. In a scroll compressor or vacuum pump, crescent-shaped pockets of gas are trapped between one or more pairs of intermeshed spiral vanes, or scrolls, one of which moves while the other remains stationary. The moving scroll orbits the stationary scroll; it does not rotate. As the moving scroll orbits the stationary scroll, the gas pockets diminish in size (i.e., they are compressed) as they move toward the outlet port of the machine.</I>
</P>
<P><I>2. In a bellows-sealed scroll compressor or vacuum pump, the process gas is totally isolated from the lubricated parts of the pump and from the external atmosphere by a metal bellows. One end of the bellows is attached to the moving scroll and the other end is attached to the stationary housing of the pump.</I>

<NOTE>
<HED><I>Technical Note to Table on Deposition Techniques:</I></HED>
<P><I>Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows:</I>
</P>
<P><I>a. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy, “composite”, dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or “laser” irradiation.</I></P></NOTE>
<NOTE>
<HED><I>Note 1:</I></HED>
<P><I>CVD includes the following processes: Directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal decomposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes</I>.</P></NOTE>
<NOTE>
<HED><I>Note 2:</I></HED>
<P><I>Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.</I></P></NOTE>
<NOTE>
<HED><I>Note 3:</I></HED>
<P><I>The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture.</I></P></NOTE>
<P><I>b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapor Deposition (TE–PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0.1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. Specific TE–PVD processes are as follows:</I>
</P>
<P><I>1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating;</I>
</P>
<P><I>2. Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species;</I>
</P>
<P><I>3. “Laser” Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave “laser” beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating;</I>
</P>
<P><I>4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition;</I>
</P>
<NOTE>
<HED><I>Note:</I></HED>
<P><I> This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates.</I>
</P>
<P><I>5. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE–PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process.</I>
</P>
<P><I>c. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of:</I>
</P>
<P><I>1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminum, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);</I>
</P>
<P><I>2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and</I>
</P>
<P><I>3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina.</I></P></NOTE>
<NOTE>
<HED><I>Note:</I></HED>
<P><I>The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1,030 K (757 °C) to 1,375 K (1,102 °C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating</I>.
</P>
<P><I>d. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying.</I></P></NOTE>
<NOTE>
<HED><I>Note 1:</I></HED>
<P><I>Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure.</I></P></NOTE>
<NOTE>
<HED><I>Note 2:</I></HED>
<P><I>High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20 °C) at 0.1 MPa.</I>
</P>
<P><I>e. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating.</I>
</P>
<P><I>f. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate.</I></P></NOTE>
<NOTE>
<HED><I>Note 1:</I></HED>
<P><I>The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporization of non-metallic coating materials.</I></P></NOTE>
<NOTE>
<HED><I>Note 2:</I></HED>
<P><I>Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition.</I>
</P>
<P><I>g. Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapor deposition or sputter deposition.</I></P></NOTE>

</P>
<P><I>Technical Notes:</I>
</P>
<P><I>1. A 'primitive computational unit' is defined as containing zero or more modifiable weights, receiving one or more inputs, and producing one or more outputs. A computational unit is said to perform 2N–1 operations whenever an output is updated based on N inputs, where each modifiable weight contained in the processing element counts as an input. Each input, weight, and output might be an analog signal level or a scalar digital value represented using one or more bits. Such units include:</I>

<P><I>2. Operations relevant to the calculation of TOPS for 3A090.a include both scalar operations and the scalar constituents of composite operations such as vector operations, matrix operations, and tensor operations. Scalar operations include integer operations, floating-point operations (often measured by FLOPS), fixed-point operations, bit-manipulation operations, and/or bitwise operations.</I>
</P>
<P><I>3. TOPS is Tera Operations Per Second or 10
<SU>12</SU> Operations per Second.</I>
</P>
<P><I>4. The rate of TOPS is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible when all processing elements are operating simultaneously. The rate of TOPS and aggregate bidirectional transfer rate is assumed to be the highest value the manufacturer claims in a manual or brochure for the integrated circuit. For example, the threshold of 4800 bits × TOPS can be met with 600 tera integer operations at 8 bits or 300 tera FLOPS at 16 bits. The bit length of an operation is equal to the highest bit length of any input or output of that operation. Additionally, if an item specified by this entry is designed for operations that achieve different bits × TOPS value, the highest bits × TOPS value should be used for the purposes of 3A090.a.</I>

<FP-1><I>Related Definitions:</I> 'Sputtering' is an overlay coating process wherein positively charged ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on the substrate. (Note: Triode, magnetron or radio frequency sputtering to increase adhesion of coating and rate of deposition are ordinary modifications of the process.)

(6) “Gateway” is the function, realized by any combination of equipment and “software”, to carry out the conversion of conventions for representing, processing or communicating information used on one system into the corresponding, but different conventions used in another system. (7) “Integrated Services Digital Network” (ISDN) is a unified end-to-end digital network, in which data originating from all types of communication (<I>e.g.</I>, voice, text, data, still and moving pictures) are transmitted from one port (terminal) in the exchange (switch) over one access line to and from the subscriber. (8) “Packet” is a group of binary digits including data and call control signals that is switched as a composite whole. The data, call control signals, and possible error control information are arranged in a specified format.

(4) Noting that items may be controlled elsewhere on the CCL, examples of items not controlled by ECCN 5A002.a.4 include the following: (a) An automobile where the only 'cryptography for data confidentiality' having a 'described security algorithm' is performed by a Category 5—Part 2 Note 3 eligible mobile telephone that is built into the car. In this case, secure phone communications support a non-primary function of the automobile but the mobile telephone (equipment), as a standalone item, is not controlled by ECCN 5A002 because it is excluded by the Cryptography Note (Note 3) (See ECCN 5A992.c). (b) An exercise bike with an embedded Category 5—Part 2 Note 3 eligible web browser, where the only controlled cryptography is performed by the web browser. In this case, secure web browsing supports a non-primary function of the exercise bike but the web browser (“software”), as a standalone item, is not controlled by ECCN 5D002 because it is excluded by the Cryptography Note (Note 3) (See ECCN 5D992.c). (5) After classification or self-classification in accordance with § 740.17(b) of the EAR, mass market encryption commodities that meet eligibility requirements are released from “EI” and “NS” controls.

</FP-1>
<FP-1><I>Related Definition:</I> For the purposes of 7B001: (1) 'Maintenance Level I': The failure of an inertial navigation unit is detected on the “aircraft” by indications from the Control and Display Unit (CDU) or by the status message from the corresponding sub-system. By following the manufacturer's manual, the cause of the failure may be localized at the level of the malfunctioning Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). The operator then removes the LRU and replaces it with a spare. (2) 'Maintenance Level II': The defective LRU is sent to the maintenance workshop (the manufacturer's or that of the operator responsible for level II maintenance). At the maintenance workshop, the malfunctioning LRU is tested by various appropriate means to verify and localize the defective Shop Replaceable Assembly (SRA) module responsible for the failure. This SRA is removed and replaced by an operative spare. The defective SRA (or possibly the complete LRU) is then shipped to the manufacturer. 'Maintenance Level II' does not include the disassembly or repair of controlled accelerometers or gyro sensors.

See also ECCNs 3A001, 3A002, 3A991, 3A992, 6A002, 6A004, 6A008, and 6A998 for specific “space-qualified” items, 7A004 and 7A104 for star trackers, and 9A004 for the International Space Station (ISS), the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and “specially designed” “parts” and “components” therefor. See USML Category XI(c) for controls on “Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit” (“MMIC”) amplifiers that are “specially designed” for defense articles.

<FP><I>Items:</I>
</FP>
<P>“Spacecraft” and other items described in ECCN 9A515 remain subject to the EAR even if exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) with defense articles “subject to the ITAR” integrated into and included therein as integral parts of the item. In all other cases, such defense articles are subject to the ITAR. For example, a 9A515.a “spacecraft” remains “subject to the EAR” even when it is exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) with a “hosted payload” described in USML Category XV(e)(17) incorporated therein. In all other cases, a “hosted payload” performing a function described in USML Category XV(a) always remains a USML item. The removal of the defense article subject to the ITAR from the spacecraft is a retransfer under the ITAR and would require an ITAR authorization, regardless of the CCL authorization the spacecraft is exported under. Additionally, transfer of technical data regarding the defense article subject to the ITAR integrated into the spacecraft would require an ITAR authorization.

<P><I>“Development” or “production” “technology” controlled by 9E001 to 9E003 for gas turbine engines remains controlled when used for repair or overhaul. Excluded from 9E001 to 9E003 control are: technical data, drawings or documentation for maintenance activities directly associated with calibration, removal or replacement of damaged or unserviceable line replaceable units, including replacement of whole engines or engine modules.</I></P></NOTE>
<NOTE>
<HED><I>Note 2:</I></HED>
<P><I>USML Category XV(f) and ECCNs 9E001, 9E002 and 9E515 do not control the data transmitted to or from a satellite or “spacecraft,” whether real or simulated, when limited to information about the health, operational status, or measurements or function of, or raw sensor output from, the “spacecraft,” “spacecraft” payload(s), or its associated subsystems or components. Such information is not within the scope of information captured within the definition of “technology” in the EAR for purposes of Category 9 Product Group E. Examples of such information, which are commonly referred to as “housekeeping data,” include (i) system, hardware, component configuration, and operation status information pertaining to temperatures, pressures, power, currents, voltages, and battery charges; (ii) “spacecraft” or payload orientation or position information, such as state vector or ephemeris information; (iii) payload raw mission or science output, such as images, spectra, particle measurements, or field measurements; (iv) command responses; (v) accurate timing information; and (vi) link budget data. The act of processing such telemetry data—i.e., converting raw data into engineering units or readable products—or encrypting it does not, in and of itself, cause the telemetry data to become subject to the ITAR or to ECCN 9E515 for purposes of 9A515, or to ECCNs 9E001 or 9E002 for purposes of 9A004. All classified technical data directly related to items controlled in USML Category XV or ECCNs 9A515, and defense services using the classified technical data remains subject to the ITAR. This note does not affect controls in USML XV(f), ECCN 9D515, or ECCN 9E515 on software source code or commands that control a “spacecraft,” payload, or associated subsystems for purposes of 9A515. This note also does not affect controls in ECCNs 9D001, 9D002, 9E001, or 9E002 on software source code or commands that control a “spacecraft,” payload, or associated subsystems for purposes of 9A004.</I></P></NOTE>
